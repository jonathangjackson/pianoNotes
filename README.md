# Assignment 2 - Piano notes
Jonathan Jackson


Desktop
On desktop users can click on the cylinders on the ground and spawn trebles. When a treble clef is instantiated a piano note is played.
The user can activate up to 4 notes and when they click on the play button all active notes are played.
To deactivate a note click on the treble clef.

Mobile
Same as the desktop users but they can send their active notes, by clicking on the export object, to the desktop user and they can hear what the mobile user has active.

I was originally going to have the user drag and drop notes onto the cylinders but implementing a grab component was too difficult.

After understanding the syntax it became easier to write the components.
